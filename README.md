# Nextra Blank

A nearly blank MDX blog/content site powered by a custom [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app) theme (see components/layout.js) w/tailwind already setup. 

The post list in the `pages/index.js` comes out of `posts.json`. If you wanted to get the Nextra page map to use on the index page, you _could_ make a stub (`pages/index.mdx` and move that "page" component into `components/layout` (just check for `route === '/'`) and render it).

Anyways, hopes this helps. Nextra rocks for static content.
